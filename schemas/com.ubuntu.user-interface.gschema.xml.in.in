        Per monitor scale factor for all user interface components.
        The values are stored in a dictionary where the keys are IDs of monitors and the values are the scale factors.
        The scale factors are not the traditional float scale factors that one might expect. Instead they are integers
        that need to be divided by 8 before being used as regular scale factors.
        That limits the number of possible scalings applied to the UI without jeopardizing flexibility (there is still 
        enough possible scalings for all devices out there). This limiting allows for better testing since there is now
        only a finite number of possible scalings.
        The scale factor also maps directly to the grid units used in the Ubuntu UI Toolkit where one grid unit is 
        exactly equal to 'scale factor' number of pixels.
